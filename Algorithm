Throw_dice Function:

Parameters:

int N: Represents the number of dice.
int faces: Denotes the number of faces on each die.
int total: Specifies the desired total.

Function Overview:

std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(N + 1, std::vector<int>(total + 1, 0));: Initializes a 2D vector dp with dimensions (N + 1) rows and (total + 1) columns, initializing all elements to zero.
This vector will store the number of ways to achieve specific totals when throwing a certain number of dice.

dp[0][0] = 1;: Sets the base case in the DP table when no dice are thrown to get a total of 0. This initialization is necessary for the dynamic programming approach.

Nested Loops:

Two loops (for loops) iterate over the number of dice thrown (i) and the desired total (j).
Within these loops, another loop calculates the number of ways to achieve the total j using i dice and all possible face values from 1 to faces.
dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][j - k];: Accumulates the number of ways by considering the previous results stored in the DP table. 
It calculates the number of ways to get the total j by subtracting the face value k from it, using i - 1 dice.
Returns dp[N][total]: Provides the final result, which represents the number of ways to throw N dice with faces faces each to achieve the desired total.

Main Function:

Initializes variables for:
N: Number of dice (3 in this case).
faces: Number of faces on each die (6 in this case).
total: Desired total (7 in this case).
Calls the throw_dice function with the specified parameters.
Outputs the result to the console, showing the number of ways to achieve the desired total by throwing the specified number of dice with a certain number of faces on each die.
Overall, this code efficiently utilizes dynamic programming to calculate and determine the number of ways to throw N dice with faces faces each to obtain a total of total.
